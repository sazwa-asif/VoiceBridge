# VoiceBridge : Learning Assistance for Special Kids
<p>This C# project, VoiceBridge, is designed to assist visually impaired children in recognizing and responding to various voices, tones, and speech patterns. Given their reliance on auditory cues, VoiceBridge serves as a crucial tool, enabling them to better understand and interact with their surroundings. The platform utilizes voice recognition to identify and distinguish between different sounds through auditory feedback. By bridging the gap between their auditory senses and the world around them, VoiceBridge offers a powerful aid in enhancing their daily lives and fostering greater independence.</p>
